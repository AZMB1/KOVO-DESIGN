## üêõ RECENT FIXES (This Session)

**Issue 1: CSS Error - `border-border` class**
- Error: Undefined class `border-border` in globals.css
- Fix: Removed `* { @apply border-border; }` from `@layer base`
- Also fixed opacity syntax with CSS variables (changed to rgba() and opacity properties)

**Issue 2: FAQ Page Syntax Error - Smart Quotes**
- Error: TypeScript syntax error from smart/curly quotes (', ', ", ")
- Fix: Rewrote entire FAQ page with straight quotes (', ")
- Location: [app/faq/page.tsx](app/faq/page.tsx)

**Issue 3: Portfolio Page Syntax Error - Smart Quotes**
- Error: Same smart quotes issue in portfolio project pages
- Fix: Manually replaced smart quotes in "brand's" and "product's" with escaped apostrophes
- Location: [app/portfolio/[slug]/page.tsx](app/portfolio/[slug]/page.tsx) (lines 248, 266)

**Result:** All pages now load successfully with no errors! Dev server running cleanly.
